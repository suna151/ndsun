            <center><strong>For this project, I decided to focus on my crying. I have clinical depression and anxiety and a result of this is that I cry. A lot. This is something I’ve always been very embarrassed by. Thus, I would often conceal this aspect of my life in front of peers, family, and even some close friends. When brainstorming for this idea, I actually had just finished crying, giving me the idea to focus on my emotions, more specifically, negative emotions. In the exercise below, I documented every time I cried every day for the span of five days and how many minutes I would spend crying. I would also document the reason of crying if applicable as well. Afterwards, I finished crying, I would pull out a sketchbook and draw a sketch of my surroundings in the space I just finished crying in. However, along with this, I would also give myself a time constraint of however many minutes my crying actually took in that specific instance. For example, if I cried for five minutes, I would sketch for five minutes afterwards.
                Through completing this project, I learned to start coming to terms with my own sadness and through that, I would create positive ways of coping. This practice forced me to essentially quickly clear my head and draw from observation, which is something I haven’t done in a while. Being able to work on a skill that I wish to improve on ended up being a very healthy way for me to cope after an anxiety attack or depressive episode by distracting me from the issue at hand temporarily.
