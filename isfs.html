                        conversation we started (via a bluetooth-enabled speaker inside the cube), passersby responded
                        with
                        a series of emotions stemming initially from curiosity and confusion, but then transforming in
                        to
                        emotions revolving around positivity, i.e. happiness, curiosity, care, and even affection.
                        Accessible and approachable, QB posed a playful critique of monolithic institutions.</strong>

                        For our first Iteration of QB, we assembled it using a cardboard box and a dowel as the center axel that turned the box on it’s side, just like The Cube of Astor Place. We then duct taped a bluetooth speaker on said axel and then concealed it within the cardboard box. Building the first iteration was difficult due to the weak structural integrity of our materials. However, we still managed to get a decent amount of interaction with the public and managed to complete our primary goal of evoking some sort of positive emotions out of our audience.

            For our second iteration of QB, instead of using cardboard, we assembled QB 2.0 by wood gluing long wooden sticks together and then stretching muslin around each face of the prism. Afterwards, we added an extra layer of duct tape to the frame to improve the structural integrity of the materials. This proved to help immensely due to the fact that the weather during our deployment was incredibly windy, causing QB to fall over a lot. But because of the increased strength of the second iteration, QB withstood the environmental challenges we faced during deployment. The second iteration of QB was immensely more successful than the first due to the more polished form of QB tended to pique the publics interest more than the first iteration.
