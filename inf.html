                “While many LGBTQ people are familiar with the intolerance of 
                <br>society at large, Asian Pacific Americans must also deal with cultural differences.
                <br> Coming out experiences are often intensified by a lack of visibility, racism and language"

        <br>	
    
            This dataset shows statistics and research in regards to substance abuse and mental health in the 
            <br>LGBT Latino and Asian community. Accumulating evidence indicates that some lesbians, gay men,
            <br>and bisexual individuals, as compared to heterosexual women and men, may be at elevated risk 
            <br>for psychological and substance use morbidity, especially lifetime histories of suicide attempts.
            <br>This source specifies what types of issues lead to these mental health problems such as the external
            <br> racism that asians and latinos face as opposed to the white LGBT community.

    <br>
    
         In countries around asia, such as Indonesia, being queer is still a huge taboo and is seen as incriminating traits. 
        <br>There has been legistation imposed to set the death penalty as punishment for being LGBT and legistation to 
        <br> imprison and fine those that are openly queer. Repressive and Opressive acts have continued to occur and rise 
        <br> in these countries such as death threats, social exclusion, excommunication, and public humiliation.

            This video was Eugene's personal perspective on growing up in America as an Asian 
            <br>and the different types of bullying he faced. He talked about being and artist 
            <br> and his interest in film that led him to discover that there was a huge lack 
            <br> of asian representation in media. He also talked about how "no one ever asked"
            <br> whether asians were capable in the first place.

                This mixed media drawing and collage was created after the extensive research that Dahee and I conducted. I wanted to capture the emotions behind my dysphoria of being a first generation Asian American along with the alienation that comes from being a gay man. The Mandarin characters on the top of the piece translates to, “I like men” and the colors used for these characters are mimicked throughout the piece. The two figures, which are me, are inevitably intertwined, symbolized by the red thread and needle connecting the two figures. The figures, have pieces cut out, which references the brokenness I feel as an individual struggling with my identity.  The red thread, specifically in Asian culture, is also known as the red thread of fate, which binds two people together. However, this red thread of fate binds me together to the other half of my self. These two halves are the embrace of my sexuality and my ethnicity, on the right, and my feelings of displacement and aloneness, on the left. These two halves of myself, although conflicting, will always be a part of me, and through creating this piece, I realized that these conflicting halves of myself are ultimately intertwined.

        <center> <img src = "3d.png"> </center>

        <p class="center">
                This three dimensional structure was created after I synthesized more information from my two dimensional study. I tried to push myself through this sculpture and create something along the lines of the abstract fine art realm. This piece was created by putting wooden sticks together and using the pressure of the string that I hand wrapped around each stick to hold the triangle in place. After the triangle was created, I added more hanging string to the form, to make it look more worn and tattered. Finally, I attached black felt to the end of the triangle. This sculpture was roughly designed based off of Taiwanese paper lanterns. The pink triangle references the pink triangle symbol that was used in World War II to mark individuals who were gay. The black felt, which symbolizes my hair, is a reference to the asian notion that cutting your hair means severing your ties and starting anew. Through this piece, I am trying to sever my ties with my homosexuality and my Asian heritage, however the sculpture acts almost like a cage, keeping me imprisoned in the person I am.            </p>
