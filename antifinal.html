                                What is Gene Editing? Gene editing, also known as genome editing, is a way of making direct and specific changes to an organism's DNA or cells. An enzyme, known as CRISPR, cuts the DNA at a specific sequence. When the cut is repaired by the cell, this is known as an edit to the sequence, resulting in gene editing. <br>

              <center> <strong> The first step of this project was to research the history and different facets of gene editing. Thus, I first looked at the origins of gene editing and the technology behind what makes modern gene editing possible. Afterwards, I then analyzed the specific points of historical impact of gene editing through the lens of modern medicine. Finally, I made sure to research the societal influences that gene editing has over the general public as well as the public opinion towards gene editing. The research that went in to this project was then synthesized into a map of the gene editing system, visualizing nodes that are inevitably intertwined and culminate into the modern understanding of gene editing.
