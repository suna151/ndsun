                <br> <br> <br> <strong> The Collector of Identity ties heavily into my culture of being an Asian American. I used fabric that reflects patterns my own Grandmother used in her life as well as using colors that are traditionally seen as “Asian.” Additionally, I wanted to create a backpack that could physically collect things, but along with this, it would also double as a collapsible low seated chair, which again references my Asian heritage </strong>
