          <strong> This data driven API utilizes JSON and p5 in order to articulate the amount of fatal vehicular car crashes by state in 2016. Creating this animated graph was definitely out of my comfort zone, however it was definitely worth the challenge. It is interesting to see that Texas has the most deaths while Tennessee has the least amount. If this project were to be extended, I would look to compare data from different and more recent years.</strong>
